# Pack Yak

Currently focused on [World vs. World](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_versus_World), the manager can be used to observe state changes in the match of a designated
world. As such, the name of the app comes from the use of [dolyaks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pack_Dolyak) to supply objectives.

Only an Android version is supported currently due to the lack of consistency and/or interoperability between multiple Compose components such as dialogs
and [Constraint Layout](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/constraintlayout).

Most backend logic within this project is hidden behind by the [GW2Wrapper](https://github.com/Woody230/GW2Wrapper) project.
